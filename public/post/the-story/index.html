                    <h1 id="what-is-breadnet"><strong><strong>What is breadNET?</strong></strong></h1>
<p>BreadNET is the name I have given my home lab. The name originated form my original nickname of breadbin from primary school. From there, branched breadNET. I had originally planned to purchase the domain of bread.net but this was taken, hence breadnet.co.uk</p>
<h1 id="what-qualifies-me-to-write-about-this-stuff"><strong><strong>What qualifies me to write about this stuff?</strong></strong></h1>
<p>Nothing at all, I am a Cloud engineer by Trade so that contributes something?</p>
<h1 id="how-did-i-get-in-to-computers"><strong><strong>How did I get in to computers?</strong></strong></h1>
<p>So It really started back in 2012/13 when I had moved abroad with an old XP computer and from there it branched out. I started out wanting to work at Openrach as a technician, but decided not to. I used to work on the welpdesk for an *msp *in Potters Bar. I had moved on and accepted a job as a Junior System administrator for a cloud based company! woo</p>
<p>It all really started falling in place at my school that had a BYOD policy and I got bored in class, as you do. I started to look at how the internet works, web pages, all those kind of things. Eventually I got IIS to work on my third laptop (see below) and it just took off from there. Whilst in India, I managed to get my second laptop to accept ubuntu as it&rsquo;s OS. From there we moved to installing apache2 and building a basic website. Since then (around 2013) I have moved back to the UK (2015) and finally had the space and the money to get better equipment.</p>
<p>The laptop that started it all. This is the one where I learnt HTML. (I&rsquo;m hopeless now)
<img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/EmbeddedImage.jpg" alt="">
This is the second laptop I owned. This was the laptop I was able to get running Ubuntu 13.04 (EOL) running with apache2 as a website. Was quite cool!
<img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/EmbeddedImage--1-.jpg" alt="">
My third laptop was my everyday driver. This is the laptop that I spent most time working from, running VM&rsquo;s and everything else you could imagine!
<img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/EmbeddedImage--2-.jpg" alt="">
Finally, my Thinkpad! A trusty Lenovo T450 rocking Linux Mint!
<img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/EmbeddedImage--3-.jpg" alt="">
I had (bare in mind this was back in 2017 I think) planned to purchase some servers and needed a rack for them. So naturally I built one&hellip;</p>
<p>The below photo is from whiteboardCAD showing the specifics of the rack design.
<img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/EmbeddedImage--4-.jpg" alt="">
Now we&rsquo;re making progress. The *server rack *is starting take place. It&rsquo;s quite solid once the rest of the cross supports were added. This was wood left over from building my desk.
<img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/EmbeddedImage--5-.jpg" alt="">
Excuse the 2003 flip phone camera quality, but this is what the finished rack looked
Photos don&rsquo;t do it justice how much of a fire hazard this was.
<img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/EmbeddedImage--6-.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="the-final-straw"><strong>The final straw</strong></h1>
<p>So after running like this for around a year I decided that it needed to go. Stuff was all over the place. I really needed to upgrade. Plus my <em>&ldquo;server&rdquo;</em> was an old computer with 8gb of ram and 2 cores.</p>
<p>I saved up from my job, which at the time was a warehouse operative, and purchased some servers and a server rack to populate some space in the garage.</p>
<p>I purchased:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Dell R210 to run the router platform</li>
<li>2 Dell R710&rsquo;s with E5520 processors, 16gb of ram each, which would run my hypervisor platform (xcp-ng)</li>
<li>1 Dell R710 with 1 E5520 to run my NAS for storage of backups and Block level storage to be presented to the VM servers (lol, never happened. electricity isn&rsquo;t free)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pictures"><strong>Pictures:</strong></h1>

This is the 48U rack I purchased off Ebay and had delivered.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t quite realize how big 48U is but <em>yeah</em>.
<img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/EmbeddedImage--7-.jpg" alt="">
The front of the rack (yes, there&rsquo;s no hard drive caddies. (<em>Were on a budget here</em>))

Rear of the rack. Sphagetttttttiiiii junction.

<h1 id="plans-for-the-future"><strong><strong>Plans for the future</strong></strong></h1>
<ol>
<li>Get more storage</li>
<li>Faster HDD&rsquo;s (or ssd?)</li>
<li>10gig (eh, half way there as of August 2019)</li>
<li>bring the 3rd server online (Just need more ram&hellip; anyone?)</li>
</ol>

                    <p><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since we&rsquo;ve done a post about truly self hosted stuff. This is in part due to me being a DevOps engineer.</p>
<p>That aside, today I aim to solve the problem of how to authenticate a k3s cluster to Google Artifact Registry</p>
<h2 id="why-we-need-to-do-this">Why we need to do this</h2>
<p>Google has a really good Container registry, called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry">Artifact Registry</a>. I am hosting all of my images on the container registry as it allows better IAM control, as well as being easier to authenticate to when using GKE.</p></p>
